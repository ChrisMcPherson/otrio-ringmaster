# Running Otrio-RL Locally

This short guide shows how to set up the project, run the tests and train the example tabular Qâ€‘learning agent. The deeper RL agents mentioned in the README (PPO, AlphaZero-style) are not yet implemented, so only the baseline components are available.

## Setup

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd otrio-ringmaster

# install dependencies (only pytest is required)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

Execute the unit tests to verify the environment works:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Training the tabular Q agent

You can train the provided baseline agent against a random opponent:

```bash
python scripts/train_tabular_q.py --episodes 1000 --checkpoint q_agent.pkl
```

Progress is printed every 100 episodes by default. The checkpoint path is optional, but allows you to resume training later via `--load q_agent.pkl`.

## Evaluating the reward scheme

A helper script `scripts/evaluate_reward_balance.py` runs two random agents and reports the distribution of wins and draws. This can be useful for verifying that the reward settings are symmetrical and working as expected:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_reward_balance.py --episodes 100
```
